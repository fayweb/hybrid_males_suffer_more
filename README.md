**Author:** Fay Webster  
**Institution:** Humboldt-University Berlin & Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research

## Project Overview
Analysis code for Chapter 2 investigating how genetic admixture affects immune responses and tolerance to Eimeria infections in wild mice.

## Quick Start
1. Open `hybrid_males_suffer_more.Rproj` in RStudio
2. Run: `source("00_master_script.R")`

## Repository Structure
## Research Questions
1. Do hybrid mice exhibit elevated inflammatory responses?
2. Are there sex-specific differences in infection tolerance?
3. How does genetic admixture affect resistance vs. tolerance balance?
